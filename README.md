# Robot Catching with Reinforcement Learning

This project focuses on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to teach robots how to catch moving objects. The aim is to create and test RL algorithms that help robots predict, track, and catch objects in dynamic environments.

## What’s Inside
- RL algorithms designed for robotic catching.
- A simulation environment for training and testing.
- Performance analysis for accuracy and efficiency.

## What You’ll Need
- Python 3.x
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- OpenAI Gym
- Libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow/PyTorch for RL models.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotcatching-rl.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up your ROS workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/robotthrow_ws
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

## How to Use It
1. Start the simulation:
    ```bash
    roslaunch robot_catching simulation.launch
    ```
